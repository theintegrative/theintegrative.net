I like to keep everything very organised, in a well documented way. This makes communication very smooth, efficient and clear. 

We engineers don't like to repeat ourselves as our conversations tend to get [dry](). While making progress, I will keep you in the loop on new updates. 

Soon you will get answers on questions like: 
- Which software do you use?
- What projects are you working on right now?
- On which platforms are you currently active?
- And the questions that you imagine right now!
