When you are creating systems there are ambiguous problems that will emerge. These are self-referential problems that are hard to recognize without some practice. From that, you gain what you can call wisdom.

## Problems

You have a list of things you want to do. When developing yourself things will grow and eventually you will run into problems with the to-do list itself. Right at that moment you will add "Create and implement a new to-do management system" to your list. 

Here things get interesting because you need a better system to do what you want. But the actions you need to take are still made using the old one. Welcome to the problems of today. The new generation of people is creating new solutions while building on top or next to the old ones.

## How can we think differently?
All change depends on changing the perspective and angle at which you approach anything. An intuitive and creative process where what you want, you initially don't know or understand. But the aha moment will come to surprise you.

### Easter eggs
Be curious. The eggs are hidden inside ideas, systems, processes, and patterns. Insight requires untangling the illusions of perception that make them seem invisible. The way you define creates the problem into the solution. Understanding is the solution to the problem. 

### Omelette, boiled or fried.
Life is mysterious. Remember when you first ate an egg? Even if you had a choice, you did not know what this egg meant before eating it. And we are not even talking about knowing the difference in how this egg can be prepared.  Here we can see one of the illusions that exist. The illusion of knowing what you want when all the choices you got initially, are unknown. 

No reason can back you up on this one other than I don't know. I refer to this one as the illusion of choice. Many times you can learn your new skill, tool, or process just by choosing one unknown to focus on first. The criteria for a good pick will eventually form themselves after you gained experience from your curiosity.

### Same chicken and egg?
This paradox will happen in every stage of your solution. Have you heard the story about the Ship of Theseus? It's like your Kubernetes cluster, but now you question if it is still the same cluster when you change the containers. In the same way, when the parts of the context change do you still have the same problem? 

## Closing thoughts
Have never written something creative like this. I actually do "like this" style of writing without embedding the command for you to "do that". If you feel free to do so, you could tell me more about what you think. Let's continue our conversation in the future! Remember to be curious when hunting for solutions.
