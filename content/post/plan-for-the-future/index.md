"The energy I invest over time is the value you can see as a result" Because without money, I value skill and energy to create value.

Feel free to analyze every detail within this post. You can go as far as asking what specific words mean and those within that answer following the questions you ask. Feedback of every type is valuable to me. Go deep without limit.

## (33/33/33) parts:

The 3 equally divided parts. Primary needs, Investments and Buffer.

### Primary needs (100)

- Health (Highest priority above everything else)
  - Quality food, water and supplements, movement
- Rent
- Insurance
- Travel

### Investments (50/50)

- Education - The knowledge, skills and experience needed to realize and maintain your goals.
- Infrastructure - The fundamental structure from which knowledge skills and experience emerge and are created.

### Buffer - This is the determining factor based on income (and health) that decides my risk tolerance (100)

- Mid-term vision - (5 years)
  - Priority 1: Primary needs (1 - 2 years)
    - Saved: 12,000 emergency fund
  - Priority 2: Maintaining, caching and securing infrastructure
    - Saved: Double the amount of buying and maintaining infrastructure 3-5 years
  - Priority 3: Research and development for the long term
    - 50% experimentation
      - 33% to unknown research projects
      - 33% to feed successful projects
      - 33% buffer for either successful or unknown research projects
    - 50% saving for long-term vision - (10 years)
- Long-term vision - (10 years)
  - Creating a regenerative healthy biohacker home and farm environment to live from
  - Be an active contributor and maintainer of trans-humanist, biohacking, technology and spiritual communities
  - Speak almost fluent English
  - Established public speaker and creative called "The Integrative"
  - Have international friends and contacts that I can trust and create with
  - Optimal health and longevity markers that are maintained and improved
  - A healthy, deep and fulfilling relationship with the one I love

## What are the Investments?:

My first priority is to invest into what has the most positive impact on the environment that I am working on. The rest you can see as creative input and insight from myself that adds value.

Depending on the stage of my buffer, the people I work for and with, time and environmental developments, the priority changes of each individual item listed in each category. This means that success is created in a non-linear way.
